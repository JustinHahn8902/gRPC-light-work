This is a simple client-server program using gRPC in Python. It is essentially just a chat between client and server with 4 different endpoints depending on if client, server, neither, or both want to stream, or if they just want to send a single message. You can run this by first running the server with "python3 server.py" and then "python3 client.py" and typing your prompts in the client side (because you are the client).
